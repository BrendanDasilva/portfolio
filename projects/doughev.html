            In this collaborative project, our goal was to re-create an online
            presence for a donut shop in London, ON. The site was initially
            built on Squarespace but ultimatley needed an update to a more
            suitable platform in Sociavore for its ease of use and its better
            built-in ecommerce capabilities, specifically for a bakery. My role
            was focused on customizing the website to align with
            <a href="https://www.thecastlerose.ca/" class="custom-link"
              >TheCastleRose's</a
            >
            creative vision from the previous site, involving a mix of
            Sociavore's native functionalities and supplimental coding in CSS to
            tailor the site's aesthetics and user interaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The challenge with this project came in two areas: a very tight turn
            around of two weeks and having to work on an entirley new platform,
            trying to recreate a site previously built. It did not take long to
            become familiar with Sociavore and the experience was actually quite
            enjoyable. What we ended up with with was a site that looked
            virtually the same as the old one but with some visual improvements,
            as well as much better functionality for the client. Sociavore also
            proved to be very user friendly for the client and a smoother user
            experience for would-be shoppers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project has been a valuable opportunity to demonstrate my
            skills in working with CMS platforms and applying custom design
            elements in a team setting, aiming for a balance between visual
            appeal and functional efficiency.
